# ðŸ§  30-Day Learning Plan: Build Your Own AI Chatbot (Like ChatGPT)

**Goal:** Build a smart chatbot that learns how to respond dynamically â€” not from hardcoded scripts â€” using machine learning and natural language processing.

---

## ðŸ”¹ WEEK 1: Programming & AI Fundamentals
**Objective**: Understand basic programming and AI concepts.

| Day | Topic | Tasks |
|-----|-------|-------|
| 1 | Introduction to AI & Chatbots | Research: What is AI, NLP, ML, ChatGPT? Write down the differences. |
| 2 | Learn Python Basics | Variables, data types, if/else, loops. Use [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) or [Python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/). |
| 3 | Functions & Lists | Practice functions, lists, dictionaries. |
| 4 | Classes & Objects (OOP) | Learn object-oriented programming basics. |
| 5 | Build a Simple Rule-Based Bot | Use Python `input()` and `if` conditions to build a basic Q&A chatbot. |
| 6 | Git & GitHub Basics | Learn how to track your projects using Git. Create a GitHub repo. |
| 7 | Project Recap & Practice | Build a slightly smarter version of your rule-based chatbot. |

## ðŸ”¹ WEEK 2: Natural Language Processing (NLP) Essentials
**Objective**: Learn how machines understand and process human language.

| Day | Topic | Tasks |
|-----|-------|-------|
| 8 | What is NLP? | Explore tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and NLTK/spaCy. |
| 9 | Text Preprocessing | Practice: Lowercasing, removing stop words, punctuation, etc. |
| 10 | Word Embeddings | Learn about Word2Vec, GloVe, and how text becomes vectors. |
| 11 | Sentiment Analysis | Use pre-trained models (e.g., `TextBlob`, `VADER`). |
| 12 | Named Entity Recognition (NER) | Use spaCy to extract names, dates, places. |
| 13 | Build a Basic NLP Bot | Input â†’ clean text â†’ classify intent (rule-based). |
| 14 | Review & Small Project | Create a basic chatbot that identifies intent and responds. |

---

## ðŸ”¹ WEEK 3: Machine Learning + Training a Smart Bot
**Objective**: Train a chatbot that learns from data.

| Day | Topic | Tasks |
|-----|-------|-------|
| 15 | Intro to Machine Learning | Understand supervised vs unsupervised learning. |
| 16 | Scikit-learn Basics | Learn how to train ML models using scikit-learn. |
| 17 | Intent Classification | Train a model to classify user intent. |
| 18 | Chatbot Dataset | Use [Intents.json](https://github.com/python-engineer/personal-assistant) or build your own. |
| 19 | Train and Test Model | Use Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression on intents. |
| 20 | Connect ML with Bot | Combine your trained model with your chatbot logic. |
| 21 | Evaluation | Test accuracy, confusion matrix, retrain if needed. |

---

## ðŸ”¹ WEEK 4: Advanced Skills & Real Chatbot Building
**Objective**: Build and deploy your own AI chatbot.

| Day | Topic | Tasks |
|-----|-------|-------|
| 22 | Using Transformers | Intro to Hugging Face, use `transformers` to load small models like `distilbert`. |
| 23 | Rasa or LangChain Intro | Learn Rasa framework or LangChain for building smarter bots. |
| 24 | Memory & Context | Implement context: track conversation history. |
| 25 | Voice + GUI (Optional) | Use text-to-speech or create a GUI with Tkinter. |
| 26 | API & Web Deployment | Use Flask to expose your chatbot via a simple web API. |
| 27 | Save & Train with Logs | Collect user inputs, retrain model with new data. |
| 28 | Connect to Telegram/WhatsApp | Use Bot APIs to deploy your bot on messaging platforms. |
| 29 | Final Project | Build your own smart chatbot that learns intents. |
| 30 | Demo & Documentation | Record a demo, write README, and upload it to GitHub. |
